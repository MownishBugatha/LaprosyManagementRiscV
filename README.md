# NoRisk
## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In an age where technology seamlessly integrates with our daily lives, the concept of a <i>smart home</i> has evolved from a futuristic vision to a tangible reality. Central to this transformation are smart door systems, which epitomise the blend of convenience, security, and innovation. These systems, which were once a speculative idea in the realm of science fiction, now offer practical solutions to everyday challenges, enhancing the way we interact with our living spaces.

Smart door systems represent the convergence of advanced technologies such as the <i>Internet of Things (IoT)</i>, <i>artificial intelligence (AI)</i>, and <i>wireless communication</i>, designed to provide homeowners with a heightened sense of security, unparalleled convenience and sophisticated control over access to their properties. Traditional keys can be easily lost, stolen, or duplicated, posing a significant security risk. Smart door systems eliminate this vulnerability by reducing the need for physical key exchanges.

Smart door systems also facilitate seamless integration with broader smart home ecosystems. They can communicate with other devices such as lighting systems, thermostats, and home security systems to create a cohesive and automated living environment.
